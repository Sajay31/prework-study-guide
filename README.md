# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Have you ever taken notes in your notebook and realized you forgot your notebook on the way to your favorite study spot with your friends?! This is exactly why I decided to create this Prework Study guide where you can keep your notes online in one central location and you even have the ability to share and update notes between friends. During the developement of this application I was able to learn the basics in css, JavaScript, HTML, and even using Github. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
